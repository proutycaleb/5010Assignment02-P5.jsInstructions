##Cat in P5.js Instructions

### Setup
- Start by creating a canvas of any size in a 4:3 aspect ratio
- This drawing will use ellipses, rectangles, trtiangles, and lines
- Assume the cat is facing the left side of the canvas

### The Head
1. Start with a slightly horizontally elongated ellipse for the skull
2. Add two triangles on top, slighlty offset for the ears.
3. For the neck use a rectangle going out of the botom right side of the skull
    1. Lines can be used later to flesh out curves
  
### The Torso
4. Start with a large elongated ellipse for the rib cage.
    1. its length should be roughly half the cats torso
    2. its height should be roughly half the front legs length
5. Use a rectangle coming out the back of the "rib cage" for the rest of the torso
    1. height is less than the rib cage, length is roughly the same
6. Make sure neck, rib cage, and torso rectangle are all slightly overlapping

### Front Leg(s)
7. A cats front legs have 2 main segments, and the feet
8. Upper segment is a vertically stretched ellipse, angled slightly towards the back
    1. Align the top of this segment near the front of the "rib cage"
9. Lower segment is a very narrow vertical rectangle, pointed straight down
10. Foot is a small elipse

### Back Leg(s)
11. The back legs have three segments.
12. The first is a large elipse simialr to the front leg, angled slightly towards the front
13. The second is a narrow rectangle angled backwards (should make a wide V shape)
14. Third is another shorter narrow rectangle, pointed straight down

### The Tail
15. Use a series of rectangles or lines for the tail
16. To add a second front and back leg repeate the same steps but mess with angles a bit to offset the legs
17. Use lines to accentueate curves as needed
